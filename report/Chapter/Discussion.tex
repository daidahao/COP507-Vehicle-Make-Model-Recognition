In this paper, a general architecture of VMMR system is proposed. Three main modules of the proposed system are Features Extraction Module, Dimensionality Reduction Module (optional) and Classification Module respectively.

A variety of features extraction methods are compared and it is concluded that SMG achives the best performance among all.
Using SVM in Classification Module produces better performance than KNN under a variety set of $K$ values.
In addition, applying PCA as dimensionality reduction method to the feature vector does not affect the performance at all.

The best performance is achieved on the dataset when SMG is used for feature extraction, PCA ($\sigma = 70$) for dimensionality reduction and SVM for classification.
The model produces an accuracy score of $99.62\%$, precision of $99.77\%$, recall of $99.62\%$ and F1-score of $99.70\%$.
Only $2$ misclassifications are made.
